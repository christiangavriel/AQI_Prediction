# AQI_Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict Air Quality Index using pollutant datasets. Implemented multiple algorithms including Random Forest, SVM, and CatBoost for both regression and classification tasks. Evaluated performance using MAE, MSE, RÂ² Score, Accuracy, and Confusion Matrix, and visualized results with Matplotlib &amp; Seaborn.
